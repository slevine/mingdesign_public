			<p>Sending and receiving referrals is a critical part of the dental practice operation. However, our users don't have a way to track the referrals they have sent out and the referrals that they have received. Without this data, the user cannot analyze patient referral trends,  measure the leading  indicators of the health of their business, and track if patients are receiving the treatment they need.            			</div>

			<p>When I was asked to join this project, the product manager had already conducted extensive user interviews and had a very pretty good idea about the user's needs. In order to have me up to speed, we had multiple sessions to go over the user diagram the PM put together. I then created my own user flow based on my understanding of the workflow and shared with him to make sure my understanding is correct and I didn't miss anything important. After a couple of rounds of discussion, I had a clear understanding of the problem and the user needs. It's time to start sketching.<p> <img src="images/referral-user-flow.png" class="samples"  width="800" alt=""/> <br>

			The user research identified three major needs for the user:
				<ul>
				<li>To track the number of referrals they have received</li>
				<li>To add new referrals they received into the system</li>
				<li>To track providers who sent referrals to them</li>
				</ul>
				
			<p>Therefore, my orginal design focused on these three functionalities. </p>

			<p><span class="figureTitle">Figure 3: Wireframe Version 1</span></p>
			<p>To make sure the solution meets the user's needs, we conducted a round of moderated testing with target users. The results came back pretty promosing: our users love the design. However, for referral-related marketing campaign, they not only want to see the campaign they run and the number of referrals generated, they would also want more detailed data to show clearly the correlation between the campaign they run and the referrals generated. This way, they could tell what type of campaigns were more successful and repeat similar campains in the future. Also, they don't particularly love the word &quot;marketing campaign&quot; because the word &quot;marketing&quot; somehow generated a negative feeling for them. </p>
			<p>Based on the testing result and user feedback, I changed the wording from &quot;marketing campaigns&quot; to &quot;source outreach&quot;. I also created new section dedicated to these activities so that the user could create a new outreach activity, set the budget for the activity, and track the people invited and the people responded. </p>
