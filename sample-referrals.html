			<div class="summary">
			<p>The process of sending and receiving referrals is crucial for the smooth operation of a dental practice. Unfortunately, our users currently lack a system to track the referrals they have sent out and received. This absence of data prevents users from analyzing patient referral trends, assessing key business indicators, and monitoring whether patients are receiving the necessary treatment.</div>

			<div class="summary">
			<p>When I  joined the project, the product manager had already conducted extensive user interviews and  had a good understanding of the user's needs.  the user's needs. To get me up to speed, we had multiple sessions to review the user diagram that the PM created. Based on my understanding of the workflow, I then developed my own user flow and shared it with the PM to ensure that I didn't miss anything critical. After several rounds of discussions, I gained a clear understanding of the problem and user needs. Now, it's time to move on to the sketching phase.

			The user research identified three major needs for the user:
				<ul>
				<li>To track the number of referrals they have received</li>
				<li>To add new referrals they received into the system</li>
				<li>To track providers who sent referrals to them</li>
				</ul>
				
			<p>Therefore, my orginal design focused on these three functionalities. </p>

			<p><span class="figureTitle">Figure 3: Wireframe Version 1</span></p>
			<p>In order to ensure that our solution meets the user's needs, we conducted a round of moderated testing with our target users. The initial results were promising, as our users loved the design. However, we found that for referral-related marketing campaigns, they required more detailed data to clearly show the correlation between their campaigns and the referrals generated. This would enable them to identify successful campaigns and repeat them in the future. Additionally, our users expressed a negative sentiment towards the term "marketing campaign".</p>
			<p>After receiving user feedback and reviewing the testing results, I made some changes to the language used in the platform. Specifically, I replaced the term "marketing campaigns" with "source outreach" based on user preferences. Additionally, I created a new section within the platform solely dedicated to these outreach activities. Here, users can create new activities, set budgets, and track invitations and responses. </p>
