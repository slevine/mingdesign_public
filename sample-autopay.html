			<div class="summary">
			<p>Verizon customers require an easier way to enroll in automatic payment. As the lead designer of the project, my team and I collaborated to find a solution to this problem.</p>
			<p>Initially, we worked independently on the project and each designed a solution. During our design review, we discovered that all three designs approached the problem from different perspectives, and we couldn't determine the best solution. To resolve this, we decided to conduct usability testing on each design to allow our customers to choose the best one.</p>
			<p>I created three usability tests on usertesting.com and had different customers test each design. The results showed that all three designs were considered easy to use and intuitive, but certain elements of each design were preferred by customers.</p>
			<p>After analyzing the test results, I combined some of the favored design elements from the other two designs with my own to create the final design. I then conducted another round of usability testing to ensure that the new design remained user-friendly for our customers.</p>

			<p>The design for Verizon's automatic payment enrollment must be consistent and work seamlessly across all three devices commonly used by customers: computers, tablets, and mobile phones.</p>
			<p>To accommodate the various business rules and corner cases that needed to be considered, I created mockups that addressed each specific use case.</p>
