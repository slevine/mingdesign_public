			<div class="summary">
			<p>Verizon customers need a more intuitive way to enroll in automatic payment. I worked on this project as the lead designer and collaborated with two other team members to create the solution to solve this problem.</p>
			<p>We started on the project independently and each created a design. We then had a design review to go over each design and tried to compare ideas. It turned out all 3 designs tried to solve the problem from different perspectives. We couldn't decide which design is the best solution to the problem. We decided to run some usability testings and let our customers decide for us. </p>
			<p>I  created 3 usability tests on usertesting.com and had different customers test out each design. At the end of the testing sessions, each design was considerred easy to use and intuitive. However, there were pieces of each design favored by customers. </p>
			<p>After studying the testing result, I took some pieces from the other two designs and combined with my own to create the final design. And then I run another round of usability testing to make sure it is still user friendly to customers.		  </p>

			<p>Most of Verizon customers  pay their bills on the computer,  the tablet, or  the mobile phones. That's why this design needs to work on all 3 types of devices with a consistent experience for the customer.</p>
			<p>Also, because there are many business rules and conerner cases we had to consider, I created the mockups that accomodate each use case.</p>
