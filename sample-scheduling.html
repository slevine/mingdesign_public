			<div class="summary">
			<p>When our software was first launched, its target users are solo dental offices. However, in recent years, a lot of offices started to grow their business and open offices at multiple locations. They share patients among locations  to  accomodate the patient's busy work and life schedule. More and more, we heard this complaint from our users that the existing scheduling calendar is not the most user friendly. They can't see more than one schedule calendar on the  screen. It takes so long to find an opening for the patient and they had to constantly aplogize to the patient. This is when we decided  it's time to improve the sheduling experience for users with this need.

			<div class="projectSecTitle">User Research</div>
			<div class="summary">
			<p>The project started with  two product managers and a UX designer (me). Before we talked to any users, we sat down and had a couple of brainstorm sessions in FigJam to make sure that we understand  the problem we try to solve. Based on our discussion, I created a user interview script to incorporate all the questions that are critical to finding the right solution. 
			<p><img src="images/schedule-brainstorm.png" class="samples" width="800" alt=""/></p>
			  <p>Next, we  recruited 5 users to talk to us about their experience with the existing feature.  These users were from offices of different sizes: a user with only 2 locations, two users with 10-30 locations, and two users with 100+ locations. </p>
				<P>The interview sessions went well and we were able to collect a lot of  useful insight. After reviewing the interview videos several times and making detailed notes, I noticed that are some common painpoints and common use patterns. </P>
				<ul>
				<li>All users think it's painful to switch from one location to another one, mainly due to the bad performance and lagging time. This obvisouly is not part of the design issue, but needs to be addressed ASAP;</li>
				<li>All users  currently manually browse through the calendar whenever they need to find an opening; </li>
				<li>It is painful to move one patient from one location to a different one because they had to delete the  appointment from the original location and create a new one from scratch at the other location;</li>
				<li>When asked whether they are aware of the &quot;Search openings&quot; feature, they were all aware of the existance of this feature. And they all, at one point, tried to use it. However, only one user said she would want to give this feature another try if we improve it. The other four users said they live on the calendar view and they didn't care much about the search function, even if we make a great improvement on it.</li>
				</ul>
				<P>The last point was totally unexpected to the whole team because we thought people would be very open to a great search function if that will save them time and make their work more efficient. That's the feature we thought we would focus on improving  for our users. Now we need to step back and take another look at the existing product. We need to figure out a way to improve the calendar view to make the feature they love suit their needs better.</P>
				<P>I created the user persona based on the user research insights. To help the team and potentially everybody who will be working on the project to better understand the user's current issues and needs, I created a story for our persona. By reading through the user's story, anybody can quickly understand what problem we try to solve, for whom we try to solve, and what needs to be addressed. </P>

			<p>Based on the user research, we know that our users love the calendar view because it's more visual and the data displayed here is more accurate. Also, it will be much easier for them to train new employees to use it. I decided that I will focus on the calendar but  give the user the capability to select the data they want to show on this calendar so that they can have a custom view of the calendar. </p>
