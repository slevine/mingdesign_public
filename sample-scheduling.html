			<div class="summary">
			<p>When our software was first launched, its target users were mainly solo dental offices. However, in recent years, a lot of offices started to grow at a fast speed and opened offices at multiple locations. They share patients among locations  to  accomodate the patient's busy work and life schedule. More and more, we hear  complaint from our users that the existing scheduling calendar is not the most user friendly. They can't see more than one schedule calendar on the  screen at a time. It takes so long to find an opening for the patient and they have to constantly aplogize to the patient. </div>
		</div>
		<div class="contentSec">
			<div class="projectSecTitle">Discovery</div>
			<div class="summary">
			<p>The team includes two product managers and two UX designers, with me as the lead designer. We started the project with  a couple of brainstorm sessions in FigJam to make sure that we understood  the problem we tried to solve. During the discussion, we grouped schedule related tasks to four categories. This helped us understand the user's routine and identify questions that were criticial to the problem solving that we didn't have an answers to.   
			It's time to conduct the user research.
			<p><img src="images/schedule-brainstorm.png" class="samples" width="800" alt=""/></p>
			  <p>As the design lead, I created a user interview script that could help us pinpoint the user's frustration points. Next, I emailed   about 80 users and asked for a 30-minute conversation. Eventually, we were able to talk to five users who came from offices of different sizes. This gave us an opportunity to find out whether users from a small practice had different painpoints from those from a big DSO. </p>
				<P>The interview sessions went well and we were able to collect a lot of  useful insight. After reviewing the interview videos several times and making detailed notes, I noticed that there were some common painpoints and common use patterns, despising the user's office size. </P>
				<ul>
				<li>All users thought it was painful to switch from one location to another one, mainly due to the bad performance and lagging time. This obvisouly was not an design issue, but needed to be addressed ASAP;</li>
				<li>All users  currently manually browsed through the calendar whenever they needed to find an opening; </li>
				<li>It was painful to move one patient from one location to a different one because they had to delete the  appointment from the original location and created a new one from scratch at the other location;</li>
				<li>When asked whether they were aware of the &quot;Search openings&quot; feature, they all knew about  this feature. And they all, at one point, tried to use it. However, only one user said she would want to give this feature another try if we improve it. The other four users said they lived on the calendar view and they didn't care much about the search function, even if we have made a great improvement on it.</li>
				</ul>
				<P>The last comment was totally unexpected to the whole team because we thought people would be very open to a robust search function if it would save them time and make their work more efficient. That was the feature we planned to focus on to improve our users' experience. With this unexpected finding, we decided that it's the best that we step back and try to come up something that will improve the feature everybody loves: the calendar view.</P>
				<P>Based on the user research insights, I created a persona to help the team better understand the user's current issues and needs. Furthermore, by analysing the user's feedback from my notes, I created a story for our persona. This user story would help all team members  quickly understand what problem we tried to solve, for whom we tried to solve, and what issue needed to be addressed. When we got to the design phase, this user story could also be used to validate any solution we came up.</P>

			<p>From the user research insights, we knew that our users loved the calendar view because it was more visual and the data displayed there was more accurate. Also, it would be much easier for them to train new employees to use it. However, it wouldn't be very useful if we simply showed the clanedar from all locations on one screen, especially for practices with  more than 2 locations. Also, there were a lot of locations with 10+ providers. Squeezing all the data on one screen would involve a lot scrolling and ended to be counter-productive for our users. </p>
			<p>It's time to brainstorm again. The designers (me and the other designer) worked out a total of 5 designs, looking at the problem from different perspectives. </p>
			<p><img src="images/scheduling-designs.png" class="samples" width="800" alt="design concepts"></p>
			<p>Next, we will evaluate each design concept with moderated usability testing and narrow it down, hopefully, to one solution.</p>
