			<div class="summary">
			<p>This project began with a clear, urgent mission: transform a legacy system to meet regulatory consent order requirements by March 2025. Phase I focused on delivering a completely reimagined system with new workflows, user roles, and modules while ensuring regulatory compliance within this strict deadline. By leveraging the standard design system, reusable components, and design patterns, we provided a foundation that was not only compliant but also user-friendly and scalable.
			  <p>Phase II allowed us to step back, engage deeply with users, and validate designs through research and testing without the pressure of regulatory deadlines. Together, these phases tell the story of how our team executed a major system transformation under pressure and then evolved to create a truly user-centered, long-term solution.

			<div class="projectSecTitle">Problem Statement</div>
			<div class="summary">
			<p>The immediate challenge was regulatory compliance – but this required a complete system transformation by March 2025. Phase I needed to replace a legacy system with entirely new workflows, user roles, concepts, and modules under strict timelines with methodology-driven requirements. Meeting this deadline was non-negotiable, making both transformation and compliance immediate priorities.</p>
			<p>However, simply transforming the system to meet regulatory requirements would not solve the bigger problem. Users needed to navigate entirely new concepts while facing friction in workflows, and small inefficiencies could create costly errors. Phase II became about evolving the transformed solution from methodology-driven to user-centered, addressing real user needs while enhancing long-term value without the pressure of regulatory deadlines.</p>

			<div class="projectSecTitle">UX Research</div>
			<div class="summary">
			<p>Phase I: Research was significantly constrained by multiple factors including delivery pressure, evolving methodology requirements, and limited design resources (team grew from 2 to 7 to 14 people during the project). The scope included brand new workflows, new user roles, entirely new concepts, and new modules - creating a steep learning curve for users while working within existing technical frameworks. Research activities focused primarily on:
				<ul>
<li>Socializing requirements with the broad stakeholder community to build understanding</li>
<li>Design reviews and rapid testing with selected key stakeholders to validate concepts</li>
<li>Abbreviated process with internal reviews to make critical design decisions quickly</li>

				</ul>
			</p>
				<p>These constraints - including ever-changing requirements, U-turns in direction, and lack of clarity on business processes - required an agile approach that prioritized stakeholder alignment and rapid iteration over comprehensive user research.</p>
			<p>Phase II: We shifted to a user-centered approach and conducted targeted research activities to uncover the real challenges faced by our users and validate potential solutions. This included:
				<ul>
					<li>User interviews and task analysis to understand workflows and identify sources of friction</li>
					<li>Usability testing with prototypes to evaluate early design concepts</li>
					<li>Iterative validation to ensure the design addressed both compliance needs and real-world usability</li>
				</ul>
			</p>
			<p>This research revealed specific pain points in navigation and workflow completion, and early user feedback confirmed that proposed improvements would significantly reduce task complexity and increase confidence in the system.</p>

			<div class="projectSecTitle">UX Design Activities</div>
			<div class="summary">
			<p>Phase I: Design activities focused on executing a complete system transformation within regulatory timelines. The team navigated the complexity of translating ever-changing methodology requirements into entirely new workflows, user roles, concepts, and modules while working within existing technical framework constraints.</p>
			<p>Key transformation challenges included:
				<ul>
<li>Complete system redesign - new workflows, user roles, concepts, and modules requiring comprehensive user education</li>
<li>Technical constraints that required building within existing framework limitations</li>
<li>Methodology constraints with evolving requirements, U-turns in direction, and unclear business processes</li>
<li>Resource scaling as the design team grew from 7 to 14 people during delivery</li>
<li>Steep learning curve for users adapting to entirely new concepts and workflows</li>
<li>Timeline pressure with the non-negotiable March deadline for regulatory compliance</li>

				</ul>
			</p>
				<p>Given the scope of transformation required, design iterations focused on ensuring both regulatory coverage and intuitive interactions within the technical and timeline constraints, while establishing standardized processes that would provide consistency across the new system.</p>
			<p>Phase II: We adopted a full design process informed by user research. Our activities included:
				<ul>
					<li>Exploring multiple design concepts to address the pain points identified in research</li>
					<li>Prototyping and iterating to quickly test ideas with users and gather feedback</li>
					<li>Collaborating closely with cross-functional teams to ensure technical feasibility and alignment with business objectives</li>
					<li>Refining designs through multiple rounds of validation to balance regulatory requirements with user needs</li>
				</ul>
			</p>
			<p>This structured, iterative approach allowed us to evolve the design from a compliance-first solution into an experience that is intuitive, efficient, and user-validated.</p>

			<div class="projectSecTitle">Impact</div>
			<div class="summary">
			<p>The project demonstrates how the team adapted to shifting priorities – from delivering urgent compliance in Phase I to driving meaningful user-centered improvements in Phase II.</p>
			<p><b>Business Impact</b>: By securing compliance on time, the organization avoided regulatory risk. With Phase II, we are now positioned to reduce inefficiencies and costly errors, helping the business operate more effectively.</p>
			<p>
				<b>User Impact</b>: The new design simplifies workflows, improves transparency and visibility that users need for informed decision making, and creates a more consistent and intuitive experience.
			</p>
			<p>
				<b>Organizational Impact</b>: The shift from requirement-driven to research-driven design illustrates the value of a structured design process. It highlights the team's ability to not only meet business constraints but also elevate the experience for long-term success.
			</p>
			<p>Together, these outcomes position the project as both a regulatory success and a showcase of how design can drive transformation within the organization.</p>

<div class="contentSec">
			<div class="projectSecTitle">Lesson Learned</div>
			<div class="summary">
			<p><b>Team adaptability is key</b>: In Phase I, we executed under requirement constraints; in Phase II, we shifted gears into a research-driven process. The ability to pivot based on context strengthened our partnership with stakeholders and demonstrated the value of UX in both fast-paced delivery and strategic design. It underscores the team's ability to balance short-term business wins with long-term organizational value – a capability that strengthens trust in design as both an execution partner and a driver of transformation.</p>
			<p><b>Foundations matter</b>: Even when time is short, grounding designs in the design system and using consistent patterns pays off later by enabling scalability and easier iteration.</p>
			<p>
				<b>User validation changes the conversation</b>: Phase II showed the power of involving users early - their feedback directly shaped solutions and helped us build a stronger case to the business for continued investment in user experience improvements.</p>
