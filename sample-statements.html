			<div class="summary">
			<p>Our enterprise users currently do not have an electronic method for delivering statements to their patients, forcing them to rely on conventional mail services. They are required to engage a third-party vendor to produce statements and then mail them to the patients via USPS. This process proves inefficient and wasteful, both in terms of resources and environmental impact.</div>

			<div class="projectSecTitle">Discovery</div>
			<div class="summary">
			<p>In our small but dedicated team, consisting of a product manager and myself as the UX designer, it became evident that we were missing a holistic understanding of our users' specific tool needs. To address this gap and create a more user-centric solution, we took the initiative to launch a comprehensive user research phase.
			<p>Upon studying the PM's high-level user stories and gaining a solid grasp of the tool's capabilities, I crafted a user interview script to better understand our user's needs. With this in place, we contacted a selection of enterprise users who were willing to  share their insights. In our discussions with these four users, we centered our inquiries on::</p>
			
			  <ul>
				<li>Frequency of sending statements to patients</li>
				<li>Timing of statement dispatch</li>
				<li>Workflow for sending statements</li>
				<li>Number of staff responsible for this task</li>
				</ul>
				<P>Our interviews revealed that users typically batch-sent statements without detailed review, having already audited them. Additionally, we discovered that users lacked a method to confirm patients' valid contact information before sending statements, often resulting in uncertainty about delivery.</P>
				<P>Additionally, we discovered that users lacked a way to verify if patients had an up-to-date contact method on file before dispatching statements. Consequently, they often sent out statements without assurance of the patient's receipt.</P>
