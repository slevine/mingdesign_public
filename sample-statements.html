			<div class="summary">
			<p>The enterprise users currently don't have a way to send statements to their patients electronically. The only delivery method available for them is mailing. They have to pay for a 3rd party vendor to generate the  statements and then send the statement to the patient through USPS. This is not an efficient way for them to handle statements. Also, it is a waste of paper and not environment friendly.</div>

			<div class="summary">
			<p>The team include a product manager and me as the UX designer. We discussed the problem we tried to solve and found that we didn't have a clear understanding of our users' needs for this tool. 
			Next step? User research of course.
			<p>After I studied the high-level user stories the PM created and after I understood the functionality of the the existing tool, I created a user interview script that will help us understand the user's needs. Next, we reached out to some enterprise users who would like to shed some lights on this issue for us.  We talked to 4 users and asked them questions like:</p>
			
			  <ul>
				<li>How often do you need to send statements to the patient?</li>
				<li>When do you usually send out the statements?</li>
				<li>Can you walk us through the steps you took to send the staement to the patient?</li>
				<li>How many people are responsible for sending out statements to the patient in your office?</li>
				</ul>
				<P>After talking with all users, we found that when the user was ready to send the statements, they usually didn't spend much time verifying statement details. This task  had been taken care of at the auditing stage. When they got to this point, they were ready to send the statement to the patient as a batch. And, sometimes, this batch could include thousands of statements.</P>
				<P>We also found out that before sending the statement to the patient, they didn't have a way to validate whether the patient had a valid communication method on file. As a result, they sent out the statement without knowing whether the patient would get it. </P>
